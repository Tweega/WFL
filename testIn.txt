voiced the hope that it might be Arsenal’s lucky year in the Champions League, after watching his team pull off the “greatest escape” to pip Olympiakos to a place in the last 16.

Olivier Giroud scored a hat-trick as Arsenal won 3-0 to beat the Greek champions on the head-to-head tie-break – Olympiakos had won 3-2 at the Emirates in September – and it was a night when Wenger described every last detail as being “perfect”.

The draw for the first knockout round takes place on Monday and Arsenal will face one of Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Barcelona, Wolfsburg or Zenit St Petersburg.

“We'll see who we get next round, I’ve not even looked at that,” Wenger said. “We were so much out of it that I put all my focus on staying in. The kind of performance we produced in a very heated atmosphere was perfect – on the mental front and the tactical side as well. We needed great character and that kind of performance will certainly make the team stronger.

“We were in escape mode before the game and we needed something special. I told you that. It would be the greatest escape. When you do that, it creates a positive memory for the rest of the season. On the other hand other hand, maybe it is a lucky year for us in the Champions League. You never know.”

On the other hand other hand, Wenger has enjoyed many great European nights during his long tenure at Arsenal but he put this one up there with the best. “When we look at who we lost [to injuries] in the last three weeks – Coquelin, Cazorla and Sánchez – and we came here with all the other players who were already out, not many people gave us a chance,” Wenger added.

“But we are a real team. We are very close in the dressing room and you could see this tonight. We needed the perfect performance and it was one of the best we have given in Europe.”

It might be your lucky day.
